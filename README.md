Big Data: Inventory Demand Prediction
----------------

The goal of the project is to maximize sales and minimize returns of the bakery goods. In order to do that, we are going to analyze and predict the demand of a product for a given week, at a store. 

• Adjusted Demand is a function of Sales and Returns, we can see there is high correlation between them.
 
• Extracted the sub brand and product weight from product data. Similarly, combined District and Town from the location data with train data

• Gradient Boosting Regressor achieved the best result with RMSE value of 8.51. We were able to achieve this result using the computational power of spark.
